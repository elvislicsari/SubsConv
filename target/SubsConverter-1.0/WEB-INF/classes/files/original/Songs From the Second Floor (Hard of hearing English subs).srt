1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,579
[Cough]

2
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,421
- Hi, Lennart, it's Pelle.
- Hi, Pelle.

3
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,419
[Cough]

4
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,389
- This bloody cough!
- Terrible!

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,323
It was good of you to come.

6
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:33,922
- Sorry, Lennart, didn't catch that.
- It was good of you to come!

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:39,596
Well sure, you asked me to,
but I can wait outside.

8
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,140
No, no, no. Stay here.
I'm flying to Barcelona at three.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,868
Right then.

10
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,878
You're not pleased, so I hear.

11
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:51,541
No, actually I'm not, Lennart.
I think it's a shame.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,585
This is no fun.
We'll soon be up to 700.

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,655
Who said anything about fun?

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,782
You know very well
we have to make it to a thousand.

15
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,723
You really mean that, Lennart?

16
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,261
I do.

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,631
[Splash]

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,735
Everything has its day, Pelle.

19
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,133
Yes, but...

20
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,435
The pyramids had their day.

21
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,837
Of course they did.

22
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,103
- Steam engines had their day.
- Sorry... didn't quite catch that.

23
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,703
Steam engines had their day.

24
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,340
That's true.

25
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,816
This is a new day and age, Pelle.
You have to realize that.

26
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,519
True enough, but still...

27
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,930
If this keeps up
we'll have to shut down entirely.

28
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,400
That would be a disaster
for a lot of people.

29
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,402
What's that got to do with us?

30
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:50,441
- You have a point...
- We won't be around then, Pelle.

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,943
Sorry, Lennart, what do you mean?

32
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,912
I mean, what's the point of staying
where there is only misery?

33
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,953
No, there's no point.

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,453
When that day comes
I'll be long gone...

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,952
...and so should you!

36
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:30,976
Beloved be the ones who sit down.

37
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:45,025
SONGS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR

38
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,648
Very nice!

39
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,720
Oh yes, the old boy
must look his best.

40
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,757
Pelle Wigert wants to
meet me today.

41
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,826
And what does he want?

42
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,156
We'll have to wait and see.

43
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,533
Lasse...

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,969
It would be nice if you could be
home today when I have my day off.

45
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,597
Sure, but how would that look?

46
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,370
I haven't missed a day in 14 years.

47
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,845
It would be nice just the same.

48
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,542
Everything has its day, dear.

49
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,151
There's a time for work

50
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,984
and there's a time
for other things.

51
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,396
No, no, no! No, no!

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,025
Everything has its day, dear.

53
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,603
You old bore!

54
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,535
Bye.

55
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,805
So long, traitor!

56
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,030
- Would you let go now!
- No, no, no, no!

57
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,930
- Pull yourself together, Lasse.
- No, no, no, no!

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,197
Pull yourself together!

59
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,204
I've been here for 30 years!

60
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,901
I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

61
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,605
- I've been here for 30 years!
- There's nothing I can do.

62
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,080
I've been here for 30 years!

63
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,914
There's nothing I can do.

64
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,454
There's nothing I can do!

65
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,052
- But I've been here for 30 years!
- There's nothing I can do.

66
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,504
I've been here for 30 years, Pelle!

67
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,650
I've been here for 30 years!

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,200
[Knocking]

69
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,740
Yes?

70
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,749
Is there an Allan Svensson here?

71
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,123
No, there isn't.

72
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,030
He's not here!

73
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,395
Close the door!

74
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,231
Excuse me,
is Allan Svensson here?

75
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,566
What are you doing here?

76
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,907
What the hell are you doing here?

77
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,208
- He's talking to you.
- What do you want?

78
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,352
- I look for man, he not here.
- Speak clearly!

79
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,944
- What did you say?
- I look for man, he not here.

80
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,758
What's up?

81
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,760
- Who are you looking for?
- Allan Svensson.

82
00:07:44,197 --> 00:08:05,245
What the hell are you doing here?

83
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,249
[He's screaming.]

84
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,674
Lasse... You-who?

85
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,348
What happened?

86
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,284
Such heavy traffic!

87
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,388
Even though it's so late...

88
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,959
What's wrong, Pelle?

89
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,758
We'll buy a new golf club.

90
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,198
We'll buy a new one!

91
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,648
May I have a volunteer?

92
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,184
Over here!

93
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,551
There's one there!
- Welcome up on stage!

94
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,419
No, leave me alone.

95
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,233
Please, come over here.

96
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,704
- May I take that for you?
- Sure.

97
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,854
Ow!

98
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,051
[Laughs]

99
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,962
[He's screaming.]

100
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,057
Ow! Ow! Ow!!!

101
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,072
[She's crying.]

102
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,614
When are you going
to get a divorce?

103
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,993
When will you do it?

104
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,031
Answer me!

105
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,828
Let's move along a bit then,
shall we?

106
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,664
Move? Oh. Right.

107
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,640
- There we go.
- Thanks.

108
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,000
[They are singing.]

109
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,231
You have to believe me, Krister.

110
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,828
You "have to" believe me!

111
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,068
I'm stuck here!

112
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,507
I haven't advanced more than
a few hundred yards in four hours!

113
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,745
- Hi.
- Hi.

114
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,545
Krister, I swear...

115
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,389
- Hi.
- Hiya.

116
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,723
Darling, what shall I do?

117
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,973
How are you?

118
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,076
What can I say?

119
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,477
It's not easy being human.

120
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,207
I agree.

121
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,585
- You saw your boy's there.
- Yeah.

122
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,419
He's been sitting and waiting
for hours.

123
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,227
You think I look like this
without reason?

124
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,764
No.

125
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,835
Dare I ask what you've done?

126
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,132
Done? I'm ruined.

127
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,138
My whole business
has burned to the ground.

128
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,640
What's that?

129
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,301
I said, the entire business
has gone up in smoke!

130
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,345
[The glass falls.]

131
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,219
Hi.

132
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,882
What have you done?

133
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,925
I'm ruined.

134
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,763
Don't you see?

135
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,162
My whole business
has gone up in smoke.

136
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,797
Look at this...

137
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,303
The books!

138
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,440
Nothing could be saved.

139
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,376
It's a fortune!

140
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,082
Maybe it's just as well...

141
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,587
Is that what you have to say to
your father, when he's in trouble?

142
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,492
I've been waiting for you.

143
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,589
I want to talk to you.

144
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,698
About what?

145
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,325
You know - the future.

146
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,099
How everything's going to... be.

147
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,403
What we're going to do.

148
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,706
How we're going to get by.

149
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,442
How we're going to put
food on the table.

150
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,812
Enjoy ourselves.

151
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,989
Does anyone know
how to get out of here?

152
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,788
No.

153
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,131
You could have called.

154
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,871
Something terrible has happened.

155
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,782
My whole business
has burned to the ground.

156
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,947
Nothing but ashes...

157
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,357
I'm the one who set fire to it.

158
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,023
And I think
I'll be discovered.

159
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,260
- Don't you see?
- Dear God!

160
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm the one who set fire to it!

161
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,670
I think I'll be discovered.

162
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,331
[He's crying.]

163
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,924
You seen that crazy traffic
over there?

164
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:47,060
It hasn't moved in over 8 hours.
No one knows why.

165
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,967
It seems the whole town
is on the road.

166
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,435
Everyone going
the same direction.

167
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,567
Makes you wonder, you know,
where they're headed...

168
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,177
...the people.

169
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,509
Do you know where they're headed?
Where they are going?

170
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,343
Well...

171
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,618
- Do you want some bread?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

172
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,749
- It's good. There's mustard on it.
- No, thanks.

173
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,761
You live around here?

174
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,835
Not any more.

175
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,835
What the hell
are you doing here, then?

176
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,872
I was just passing by.

177
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,173
I used to live up there.

178
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,975
At the top,
to the left of the drainpipe.

179
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,084
Really?

180
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,745
- I got thrown out.
- Thrown out?

181
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,789
Yeah, she didn't want me anymore.

182
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,952
Man, that's sad.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

183
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,663
God damn...

184
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,496
Ask me, I know.

185
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,695
What's her framerateFrom?

186
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,567
Susanne.

187
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,105
Susanne...

188
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,806
- Susanne, don't be so cruel!
- Shhh!

189
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,438
Open your door to a man
who hungers and thirsts.

190
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,420
Don't be so cruel, Susanne!

191
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,388
Damn, what beasts!

192
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,994
Maybe there's more...

193
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,769
Susanne!

194
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,071
Don't be so cruel, Susanne!

195
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,874
Open your door to a man
who hungers and thirsts.

196
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,541
Who the hell is that?
How do you know him?

197
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,085
I don't know who it is.

198
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,229
You've got to believe me, Micke!

199
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:03,357
It's true...
I don't know who it is.

200
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,208
Yes, well naturally,
I tried to put it out.

201
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,148
But it was impossible.

202
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,814
I was about to catch fire myself.

203
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:33,590
You see here before you
a fortune turned to ashes.

204
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,259
Everything seems
to happen to me!

205
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:41,168
One catastrophe after another.

206
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,171
Have there been other fires?

207
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,436
No, there haven't.

208
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,979
There are other catastrophes
besides fires.

209
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,640
That are much worse.

210
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,251
I have two sons.

211
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,218
The oldest...

212
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:02,224
...he's seriously ill.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

213
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,297
Yeah, he's lost his mind.
Writing poetry made him nuts.

214
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,797
Oh dear!

215
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,299
Yes, it's terrible.

216
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:15,668
What's a few charred pieces of
furniture compared with that?

217
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,707
Nothing!

218
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,546
Of course, they were expensive.

219
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,809
Well... not this one.

220
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:31,889
But there was a Chippendale suite
over there.

221
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,830
A sofa.

222
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,865
Two armchairs.

223
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,904
Top quality!

224
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,100
78000.

225
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,708
Do you have that on paper?

226
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,214
Paper?

227
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,376
Obviously,
they've gone up in smoke.

228
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,819
But a Chippendale
is a Chippendale.

229
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,391
Even if it doesn't say
it on paper!

230
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,091
You, for example.

231
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,095
You are who you are,

232
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,200
whether or not
anybody's made note of it.

233
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,199
- Aren't you?
- I suppose.

234
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,134
Yep, we'll just have
to believe it.

235
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,168
This, this is my youngest son.

236
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,175
They're from
the insurance company-

237
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,646
- or so they say...

238
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,980
So, we'll just... have to take
their word for it.

239
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,190
[The crowd is screaming.]

240
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,322
In case you have trouble
understanding this,

241
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,661
you may as well
join the demonstration

242
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,736
and do some good.

243
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,568
Stock prices are falling.

244
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,371
The country's
in a very bad way.

245
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,543
They're fighting
for better times

246
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,414
and here you stand
and quibble over

247
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,749
a sofa and a few armchairs.

248
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,511
[Screaming]

249
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,931
[Screaming]

250
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,057
Hi, Tomas!

251
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,252
Here we go again...

252
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,133
What have I done, Tomas?
What have I done wrong?

253
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:35,138
He's not answering.
He's not answering today either.

254
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:39,607
Can't even say "hi"
to his own father!

255
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:44,010
He's been writing poetry
and it made him nuts.

256
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,419
It's okay, Tomas.

257
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,189
The kids are fine.

258
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:57,590
Elisabeth too.

259
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,425
I drop by now and then.

260
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,590
You don't have
to worry about them.

261
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,362
Or about the cab.
I drive as much as I can.

262
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,995
It's a lucky thing
somebody's taking care of business!

263
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,305
He's left his cab and family
high and dry.

264
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,039
Writing poetry
till he went nuts.

265
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:21,619
It's awful! It's just awful!

266
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,846
[The father is crying.]

267
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,351
Beloved be the unknown man
and his wife.

268
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,465
My fellow man with sleeves,
neck and eyes!

269
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,506
Beloved be the one
who sleeps on his back.

270
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:49,202
The one who wears
a torn shoe in the rain.

271
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:55,646
Beloved be the bald man
without hat.

272
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,051
The one who catches
a finger in a door.

273
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,683
Catches a finger...
What's so special about that?

274
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:08,390
It's happened to everyone.
Writing poetry made him nuts.

275
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:15,162
Beloved be the one who sweats
out of pain or out of shame.

276
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,332
What kind of nonsense is this?
Give me my smock.

277
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,646
The smock!

278
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,955
The one who pays with
what he does not have...

279
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,026
There was a wallet here too.
Where is it?

280
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,165
Beloved be the ones
who sit down.

281
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,101
Sit down?!

282
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,366
- What's with that?
- Calm down now!

283
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,999
Beloved be the one
who sits down?!

284
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,509
Easy!

285
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,807
Why should you love him, eh?

286
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,143
- Look at that brother of yours.
- Take it easy!

287
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,012
He sits where he sits.

288
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,312
No yelling in here.
Calm down now.

289
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,979
Sit down, sit down...

290
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:09,854
He sits where he sits!

291
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,697
Who's going to come along
and love him, then?

292
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,769
Can no one help him?

293
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,506
It's good of the Father to let me
come and talk to him.

294
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,854
See, it's like this...

295
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,552
[He's crying.]

296
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,761
My entire business
has gone up in smoke.

297
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,805
It's nothing but ashes.

298
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,203
And I have a son
who's gone mad.

299
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,374
Makes you wonder
what you've done wrong...

300
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,820
You can't talk to him.

301
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,088
He doesn't respond.

302
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,130
I'm at my wits' end.

303
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,599
At your wits end...
So, who isn't?

304
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,365
I've been trying to sell
my house for four years.

305
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,474
No such luck.

306
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:43,274
Yep, I'll lose 200 thousand -
at least.

307
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,974
That's a shame.

308
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,551
A shame. A real shame.

309
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:53,487
What about me, then? I paid for
a trip and then the travel agency

310
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,491
went bankrupt, the money's gone.

311
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,221
It's all because
of the stock prices.

312
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,298
They... they go up and down.

313
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,561
- It's frightful!
- I quite agree.

314
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,434
Beloved be the one
who sits down.

315
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,134
I beg your pardon?

316
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:18,044
Beloved be the one
who sits down.

317
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,761
[Music]

318
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,361
We can go with this.

319
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,772
[She's crying.]

320
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,647
When are you going to do it?

321
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,024
You could answer at least!

322
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,249
It's nice to sit down
for a bit.

323
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,983
I've walked all the way
from North Station.

324
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,284
I thought...

325
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,758
"It'll be quicker to walk",
I thought.

326
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,125
In chaos like this,
that just goes on

327
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:57,030
without anyone being able to give
a reasonable explanation.

328
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,159
But it was a long way!

329
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,635
Longer than I thought.

330
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,837
I'm in a hurry. I'm late.

331
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,673
I overslept.

332
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,215
- I had nightmares.
- Oh dear!

333
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,614
Where are we going?

334
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,584
I'm going to visit our former
Commander-in-chief

335
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,748
who has a birthday today.

336
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,088
- He's turned a hundred.
- I see...

337
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,093
Where does he live?

338
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,963
Where do you think someone lives
who's reached such a venerable age

339
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,400
and who doesn't have
to pinch his pennies.

340
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,402
St. George's rest home.

341
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,633
St. George's. O.K.

342
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,644
A lot of people will be paying
their respects.

343
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,841
Admiral Bengtsson
is going to make a speech.

344
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,453
And can you guess
who wrote the speech?

345
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,350
No.

346
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,553
I did.

347
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:01,859
That's my main job these days,
writing speeches...

348
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,298
But it still makes me nervous
every time.

349
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,563
Terribly nervous.

350
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,701
Fact is, I had to nip into
the Grand Hotel and have a drink.

351
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,745
I needed one.

352
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,717
Well, three...
to be perfectly honest.

353
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,323
So now I'm actually quite
pleased with what I've written.

354
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,959
My approach was a rather
philosophical one.

355
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,829
About being human
year after year...

356
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,003
This is how I see it...

357
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:48,100
Life is time and
time is a stretch of road.

358
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,339
That makes life a journey, a trip.

359
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,110
- Don't you think so?
- Yes.

360
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,254
I guess you could
look at it that way.

361
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,256
Yet in order to travel you need
a map and a compass.

362
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,759
Otherwise you wouldn't know
where you were.

363
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,523
- Would you?
- No.

364
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,066
And our map and compass...

365
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,227
...are our traditions.

366
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,362
Our heritage, our history.

367
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,670
- Aren't they?
- Yeah, sure.

368
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,335
If we don't understand this...

369
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,677
Before we know it,
we're fumbling around in the dark.

370
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,616
Where are we?

371
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,416
Well, actually we haven't moved
more than a few yards.

372
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,389
- We haven't?
- No.

373
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,910
They keep delivering
more flowers!

374
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,849
Sure they do - when someone
celebrates his 100th birthday!

375
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:07,981
And has been so clever! Become both
a general and a millionaire!

376
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,683
Millionaire?!
To put it mildly!

377
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,696
He's one of the largest landowners
in the country.

378
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:18,563
20000 acres of cultivated land
and twice as much forest.

379
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,899
How much is that?
60000 acres.

380
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,701
How many square meters is that?

381
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:28,710
- 240 million, isn't it?
- Exactly!

382
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,145
Two hundred and forty million
square meters of land.

383
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,844
And eight lakes on his property.

384
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,223
- Fantastic!
- Unbelievable!

385
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,986
Really.

386
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,127
Uh-oh. I think it's time
for the bed-pan.

387
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,062
- Anna, the bed-pan!
- Coming...

388
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,440
They're here now.

389
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,710
They're here now.

390
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,181
Right honorable general and
Commander-in-chief Emeritus.

391
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,223
It is man's fate to grow older.

392
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,193
Year is added to year,
experience to experience

393
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,730
during our never-ending journey
around the sun.

394
00:43:55,866 --> 00:44:00,326
Honored general and, if I may
say so, dear colleague.

395
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,032
Few people are privileged

396
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,039
to have completed such a
large number of orbits

397
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,304
around the sun
as you, sir, have done.

398
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:14,247
Today when you set out on
a new orbit, your 101st,

399
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,886
I, as an active member of

400
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,012
the joint Chiefs of Staff,

401
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,851
have the task, pleasure
and honor

402
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,086
on behalf of all branches
of the armed forces

403
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,756
to extend our hearty congratulations
to you,

404
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,764
sir as a person
and as a human being

405
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,766
and as a representative

406
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:36,737
of the safeguarding of our
country, our traditions

407
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:40,469
our distinctive character
and our history.

408
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,670
My best to Goering!

409
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:46,078
- I beg your pardon?
- My best to Goering.

410
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:54,019
Sound the regiment's
recognition signal.

411
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,628
Hoist the flags!

412
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,828
Hoist the flags!

413
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,167
Hoist the flags!

414
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,071
[Bugle]

415
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,818
- Where have you been?
- Sorry...?

416
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,987
Hi!

417
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,828
What do you mean, "been"?
I've been all over.

418
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,869
I've driven all over town
around and around...

419
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:21,034
...and listened to people
with problems.

420
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,408
I asked where you've been!

421
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:27,313
Yeah... and then...

422
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,885
Well, then I felt like
having a beer.

423
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,320
At least three, to be honest.

424
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,429
At least six, to be honest.

425
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,432
You could have called.

426
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,629
Seven, to be perfectly honest.

427
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,967
You didn't need to come here.

428
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,438
For Christ's sake,
should just sell

429
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:01,984
that damned car this minute.

430
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,553
Tomas can't drive a cab.

431
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,954
He's too soft.

432
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,492
He takes everything to heart.

433
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,665
What?!

434
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,428
What's wrong?
Am I not allowed here?

435
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,801
- Why not?
- You don't love me.

436
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,906
Beloved be the one
who sits down.

437
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,558
Beloved be the one
who sits down!

438
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,033
...who sits down.

439
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,704
Beloved be the one...

440
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,451
Rune...

441
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,588
"Do unto others"

442
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,593
"as you would have them do
unto you. "

443
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,335
In other words...

444
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,271
If you want me
to make you happy,

445
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:35,868
you have to make me happy.

446
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,277
Right?

447
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,818
But you haven't done that!
You've made me damned disappointed.

448
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,217
Have you seen the nails?

449
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,791
You come here, you sit down
and start talking business

450
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,554
without any cash.
Who the hell do you think you are?

451
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:55,631
I was thinking you could give them
to me on credit, Uffe. 30 days...

452
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:00,294
30 days?! Who the hell knows
what could happen to you in 30 days?

453
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,339
I'm really in a bind, Uffe.

454
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,807
Kalle! Well, I'll be damned!

455
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,175
- You're here this year too!
- Yeah, so they say...

456
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,283
Alive and kicking! And here I was
thinking you'd burnt to death.

457
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,475
How're you doing?

458
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,314
Oh, you know how it is, Uffe,
in times like these.

459
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,321
You have to struggle
for every crumb.

460
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:26,828
Try to find something you can sell
with an extra zero on the end...

461
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,990
In that case you've come to the
right place, Kalle. Take a seat!

462
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,708
- Hi, Kalle.
- Hiya.

463
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:46,509
- Sit down.
- Sure.

464
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,379
So, this is what you're up
to this year.

465
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,579
Yes, I too have to survive.

466
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,624
Here is the product you can put
two extra zeros on.

467
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,354
- You think so?
- Think?!

468
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:03,227
We're heading for the year 2000.
Two thousand, Kalle!

469
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,267
And this here is the birthday boy.

470
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,394
You get a chance like this
only once in a lifetime.

471
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,403
It'll be another thousand years

472
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,735
before this man
is as important again.

473
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,572
I guess I won't be around then.

474
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,273
This, this suits you, Kalle.

475
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:23,045
It suits an old furniture salesman.

476
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,316
Come here. Between you and me...
check it out.

477
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,356
There are already too many in

478
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,189
on the champagne
and fireworks.

479
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,627
Choose three sizes.

480
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,792
Take along an order-book.
Get out there and make some money!

481
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:43,304
Yeah... I don't know, Uffe.
I'm so tired.

482
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,341
I already have a cross to bear.

483
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,809
The insurance company
is giving me a hard time.

484
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,278
Besides my son has gone mad.

485
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,781
He what...?

486
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,282
Yeah, he's been writing poetry
and it made him nuts.

487
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,421
Well, it won't be a bread winner
but that'll blow over.

488
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,988
It'll blow over, Kalle.

489
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:04,616
- You think so?
- You shouldn't think so damn much.

490
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,729
It's not good.

491
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,342
[The man is screaming.]

492
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:42,092
- What happened?
- That's a good question.

493
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,723
He's stuck.
He's stuck in the door.

494
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,894
Well, that's pretty damned obvious.
But how did it happen?

495
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,903
He slipped, I guess.

496
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,235
- Slipped?
- Yes.

497
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,276
- How clumsy can you get?
- It could happen to anyone.

498
00:51:55,412 --> 00:52:01,612
He slipped and fell backwards and
hit his other arm against the door.

499
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,221
- And it shut.
- Well, it's clumsy all the same!

500
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:11,190
Try to take it easy.
We'll help you in a minute.

501
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:16,595
My colleague will come and open
the door carefully from the inside.

502
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,836
Here he is now.
He's opening the door now.

503
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,289
- That's not so bad.
- That wasn't so bad now, was it?

504
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,586
It wasn't so bad.

505
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,128
It wasn't so bad, was it?

506
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:09,244
Poor man!
It could happen to the best of us.

507
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:12,354
Our son got himself stuck
in a deckchair last year.

508
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,356
- No, it was three years ago!
- Wasn't it last year?

509
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,619
No, it was three years ago.

510
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,787
What about me! I got my finger
caught in a dresser drawer

511
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,331
and it really hurt.
And that was ten years ago.

512
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,094
And look,
you can still see the gash.

513
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,827
- Hi.
- Hi.

514
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,368
- It's been ages...
- Yes, it has.

515
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,755
It really became barren.

516
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,526
- You really scared me, Sven.
- I did?

517
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,728
Yes, you did.

518
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,500
I suddenly felt really guilty.

519
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,235
When I caught sight of you, Sven.

520
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,971
You understand, I guess.

521
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,413
- You know what I thought?
- No.

522
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:28,785
As a matter of fact,
I thought you were dead, Sven.

523
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,551
I heard you'd committed suicide.

524
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,561
Yes, that's right.

525
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,436
For Christ's sake, Sven!
Why did you do that?

526
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,099
I had no choice.

527
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,545
Sven, am I to blame?

528
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,446
- Is it my fault?
- I didn't say that.

529
00:55:55,618 --> 00:56:00,078
[Russian]

530
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,121
He's so unhappy, the poor boy.

531
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:05,694
- What does he want?
- He's gone astray, got lost.

532
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,559
- Are you looking for me?
- He's looking for his sister.

533
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,394
- Sister?
- Yes, his sister.

534
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,697
The Germans hanged her
over in Russia...

535
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,931
[Russian]

536
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,132
Then they hanged him too.

537
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,670
He's so very unhappy,
because he didn't have time

538
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,678
to apologize to her.

539
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,409
- If I've understood correctly.
- Apologize, for what?

540
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,246
He'd done something mean.

541
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,411
Hurt her, I think.

542
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:36,821
And regretted it, but he didn't
get a chance to make it up to her.

543
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,896
[Russian]

544
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,818
- Please!
- That's awful!

545
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,829
I can't bear to listen.

546
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,763
What had they done?
Why did they hang them?

547
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,369
Something to do with being
from the wrong race, I think.

548
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,337
- What?
- They belonged to the wrong race.

549
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,136
Oh dear, oh dear...

550
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,767
What happens now?
What's he going to do now?

551
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,676
- Who?
- The boy.

552
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,046
What do you mean, "do"?
He can't do anything.

553
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,346
That's why he's so sad.

554
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,989
Don't you see?

555
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,785
He didn't get a chance to make amends
with his sister before he died

556
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,053
while she was still alive.

557
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:24,030
Then he was hanging there
himself from the rope...

558
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,594
That's why it's so tragic.

559
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:33,539
Because he can't do anything
can't even try...

560
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,304
He's dead.

561
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,573
They both are.

562
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,983
Sven, how much
did I borrow from you?

563
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,684
Was it 280000?

564
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,422
No, I know, it was 287...

565
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,426
Excuse me for saying so, Sven,
I'm only being honest with you...

566
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:08,905
...but I was relieved
when I heard you were dead.

567
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:14,039
"Now I don't have to pay back
the money," I thought to myself.

568
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:18,654
There wasn't any papers.
I was free from my debt...

569
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,653
[Russian]

570
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:24,089
Good God, Sven,
what should I do?

571
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:28,425
I can't very well pay back
the money now, can I?

572
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,556
To me? That would be difficult.

573
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,937
I'm only human, Sven.

574
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,670
A man does the best he can
struggles to get a bit...

575
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,872
...of food on the table.

576
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,176
And enjoy himself.

577
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,271
Jesus...

578
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,675
He wasn't the son of God.

579
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,250
He was just a nice guy.

580
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,912
That's why he was crucified.

581
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,954
- He was tormented and killed.
- What?

582
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,961
He was tormented and killed.

583
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,430
- Who?
- Jesus.

584
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:41,526
- He was crucified.
- Of course he was.

585
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,203
Because he was a nice guy.

586
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,608
Hi, Tomas.

587
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:58,913
- Hello.
- Hi.

588
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,823
You could at least say "hi"!

589
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:09,057
- When your grandma's here and all!
- Take it easy.

590
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,365
Forgive me, Tomas.

591
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,534
I had something fun to tell you.

592
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,307
- I've got a new business concept.
- Me too.

593
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:30,215
I've got a business concept too,
but it's secret.

594
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,191
Imagine, Tomas...

595
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,858
The insurance company gave in.

596
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:45,195
And why do you think
they did that?

597
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,963
You've got to be able
to speak up for yourself.

598
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:53,405
Speak plainly
and you'll get results...

599
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,438
You can write poems
with words too.

600
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,050
It's not that.

601
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,710
Why complicate things, Tomas?

602
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,382
Life is a market.

603
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,460
It's as simple as that.

604
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:19,960
It's all about buying something
you can sell with an extra zero.

605
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,230
Or two.

606
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:27,274
The whole world knows that
everyone but you, it seems.

607
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:31,312
Is there no one
who can help you?

608
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,474
- Is there no one who can help you?!
- Take it easy!

609
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:40,486
Writing poetry
till you went nuts, huh?

610
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,591
Easy does it.

611
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,420
It's awful!

612
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,688
Is there no one who can help him?

613
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,825
Is there no one who can help him?

614
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,936
...that's why he was crucified.

615
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:58,666
...who can help him?
- Calm down.

616
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:01,834
Is there no one who can help him?

617
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,098
It would of course
be an advantage

618
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:26,395
if the chairman of the Economic
Faculty's council of experts

619
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:30,666
could at this point present
at least the main features

620
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,038
of the long-term perspectives
and strategies

621
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:37,613
which the council would like
to propose to the government.

622
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:43,913
Long-term... I don't know if
I have those with me here today,

623
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:47,522
but the short-term ones
should be here somewhere...

624
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,591
One moment, please.

625
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,526
Strange. I'm sure I had them
this morning.

626
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:22,118
This is obviously not good.

627
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:26,251
It appears that we shall
have to skip the strategies

628
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,796
and concentrate
on tactics instead.

629
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:34,665
But before we do so, we should
perhaps attempt to summarize

630
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,364
what we've discussed here today.

631
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:41,374
It's difficult, I know.

632
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,138
Our discussion has lasted
over eight hours

633
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:50,014
but is there anyone who feels
they'd like to have a try?

634
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,656
Anyone?

635
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,985
Professor Frank, for example,

636
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:00,152
hasn't said anything
for a long time.

637
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:05,791
Well, I agree with
what most of the others

638
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,563
have had to say today.

639
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:13,334
All we can do is hope.

640
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,508
Would Dr. Wendt
care to comment on that?

641
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:20,946
The house across the street,
it's moving.

642
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,678
- I don't follow you.
- It's moving.

643
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,322
That house over there.

644
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,914
- What do you mean, "moving"?
- It's moving!

645
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,690
That's right, it is!

646
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,664
What kind of nonsense is that?

647
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,167
Hey...

648
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,669
It's moving...

649
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,205
- It is moving!
- It really is!

650
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,797
Take it easy! Take it easy!

651
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:23,537
The doors open inwards.
Back up! Hey!

652
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:40,820
It's very important
we don't lose control.

653
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,833
Very... important!

654
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:30,075
What papers
are you looking for?

655
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,077
What papers?

656
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,239
An official report.

657
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,181
A very troublesome report

658
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:42,290
which is supposed to clarify
why we can't afford to work.

659
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,363
You'll just have to write
a new one!

660
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,626
Try to remember what was in it.

661
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,032
Write a new one!

662
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,105
What was in it?

663
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,072
There wasn't very much in it.

664
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:04,475
It's hard,
it's very hard to explain

665
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:08,413
why we can't afford to work.

666
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,984
It's impossible!

667
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:22,230
It's not us who decide
that sort of thing.

668
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,424
We're not the ones who decide.

669
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,627
We must understand that.

670
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,900
It's fate that decides.

671
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,442
Not us. Fate.

672
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,672
Who can decide over fate?

673
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:41,112
Not us anyway.

674
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:46,550
All we can do
is try to appeal to fate.

675
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:50,625
That's all we can do.

676
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,744
[Russian]

677
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,585
[Russian]

678
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,664
[Russian]

679
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,599
You'll have to forgive me,
but I'm afraid I can't help you,

680
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,138
because I can't understand
what you're saying.

681
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:43,038
[Russian]

682
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,739
Like I said, I can't help you.

683
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,947
Help!

684
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,992
Ow! I'm stuck!

685
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,698
Enough is enough!
Get out of here!

686
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:11,622
Well now, Anna. From what
we've heard you're feeling fine,

687
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,625
not sick or anything.

688
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:16,128
- Yep, very healthy.
- I see.

689
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,130
- She's very healthy.
- She is, is she?

690
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,462
And you're doing well in school.

691
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:24,368
You're good at reading and writing
from what your mum and dad tell us.

692
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,098
I see.

693
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:29,301
- Have you read many books?
- Yes, a few.

694
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:30,935
I see.

695
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,449
You see, these ladies and gentlemen
sitting here...

696
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:39,485
...they've read all the books.
- That's right! An awful lot!

697
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,181
- Yes, most of them!
- Yes.

698
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,451
And when you've read that much,

699
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:47,187
well, then you also know
an awful lot.

700
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:50,662
Yes, and we also have
the benefit of experience.

701
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,198
Quite right.

702
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,030
Long experience, I might add.

703
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,035
Yes, indeed.

704
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,265
That's how you know
and how to do it.

705
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:07,838
And, Anna, there's one more thing
you know if you've read that much.

706
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:12,852
You know what can't be done,
what's impossible.

707
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,421
Exactly!

708
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,820
Because you can't do
just anything.

709
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:18,824
Certainly not.

710
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:23,557
An ant, for example, can't eat up
an elephant. It's impossible.

711
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,667
Right.

712
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,962
And when it's your birthday,

713
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:31,163
well, not everyone
can come to the party.

714
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:35,640
If they did, then everyone would get
a piece of cake this little.

715
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:39,475
- No bigger than a crumb!
- So small you could hardly see it!

716
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:43,278
- That wouldn't be such a fun party.
- No, darn it!!

717
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:48,480
I can see you understand that.

718
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,453
But there are other things, Anna,

719
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,960
that are impossible
and that can't be done.

720
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,327
That you can't really understand

721
01:13:57,466 --> 01:14:00,458
when you're small
only when you're big

722
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:03,332
and have read many, many books.

723
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:07,602
And then there's also experience.
You mustn't forget that!

724
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,871
- No, absolutely not.
- No...

725
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,051
Aaaah!

[Music]

727
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,355
I can't get up.

01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,522
Help! I can't get up!

729
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:37,108
We have sacrificed
the bloom of youth.

730
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:40,915
What more can we do?

731
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,750
Nothing.

732
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:49,057
- What?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing

733
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,427
What more can we do?

734
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,836
- Where are we?
- Huh?

735
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,315
Where are we?

736
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,475
At the Grand Hotel,
for Christ's sake!

737
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,590
Oh...

738
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,352
What more can we do?

739
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,459
What?

740
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:25,430
- But, where are we?
- I can't get up.

741
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,869
- Where are we?
- I can't get up.

742
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:49,150
- Where are we?
- I can't get up.

743
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,546
What's wrong now,
then, Robert?

744
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,345
It's heavy, Pelle.
I can't take it any more.

745
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,012
You have to, Robert.
You have to try!

746
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,385
Come on!

747
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:14,969
Hang in there, Pelle!
You've got to hang on!

748
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,010
Yes, I know. I know.

749
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:24,981
- There's a time for everything.
- Sure, right.

750
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,144
Pelle!

751
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,187
There's a time for misery.

752
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,189
Sure, I know there is.

753
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,590
But it'll soon be over.

754
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,593
Only a few more yards

755
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,255
and we'll have left this damned
dump under the clouds for good.

756
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,265
Yes. Let's hope so.

757
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,768
- As free men, Pelle.
- Sure, right. Sure...

758
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,769
- Free at last!
- Yes!

759
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,431
And then we'll only have
ourselves to think about.

760
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,441
Right, sure, that'll be nice.

761
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:53,708
And do what we feel like!

762
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,646
Sure. Sounds good.

763
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,153
Do we not deserve that, Pelle?

764
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,849
Aren't we worth it,
when we've worked so hard?

765
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,459
Only a few more yards!

766
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:10,861
A new day is dawning!

767
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,366
Come on then!

768
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,719
There's a time for everything,
Tomas.

769
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:45,565
There's a time for everything.

770
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,934
Your time will come, Tomas.

771
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:54,806
It will... I know that.

772
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,482
It's not true that
no one cares about poetry.

773
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,584
They just pretend they don't.

774
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:09,690
Right now...

775
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:12,384
They're just pretending.

776
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,655
That's how it is. I know.

777
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,442
Beloved be the one who works

778
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:39,246
by the day, by the month,
by the hour.

779
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:49,656
Beloved be the one who sweats
out of pain or out of shame.

780
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,097
The person who goes, at the order
of his hands, to the movies.

781
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,606
The one who pays with
what he does not have...

782
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,209
The one who sleeps on his back.

783
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,438
[Tomas is crying.]

784
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,810
The one who no longer remembers
his childhood.

785
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:10,474
Stop it, Stefan!
You'll only make him unhappy.

786
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:15,180
You mustn't be unhappy, Tomas.
You mustn't cry!

787
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:26,494
Take it easy, Tomas,
it doesn't matter.

788
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,864
Beloved be the one
who sits down.

789
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,972
It's okay to cry.

790
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,666
That's what you should do
when you're unhappy.

791
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:38,108
- Jesus did.
- What?

792
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:42,273
Jesus cried when he was
on the cross.

793
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,418
He hurt so much.

794
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:47,282
He was crucified...

795
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,787
...because he was a kind person.

796
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,256
Kind?

797
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:54,259
Tomas is kind, too...

798
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,162
...but he's got no head
for business.

799
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:01,166
Of course you're unhappy!

800
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:06,798
Jesus didn't either.
He just hurt.

801
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,465
Yeah, sure.

802
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:12,341
He was tormented to death
because he was kind.

803
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,713
He wasn't the son of God.

804
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,375
He was just a kind person.

805
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,111
Sure.

806
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,961
Beloved be the just man
without thorns.

807
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:34,196
[Tomas is crying.]

808
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,235
The bald man without hat.

809
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,500
The thief without roses.

810
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:47,914
The one who wears a watch
and has seen God.

811
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,513
The one who has honor
and does not die!

812
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,512
Are you here, Uffe?

813
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,417
It's been a long time.

814
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,493
I'm ashamed, Kalle.

815
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:18,337
I'm ashamed.

816
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:23,372
- It was a bad idea.
- Yeah...

817
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,605
The worst I ever had.

818
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:29,981
Shit!

819
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:32,051
Damn it all!

820
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,421
How could I be so stupid?

821
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,855
Out of my mind.

822
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:42,452
To think you can make money
on a crucified loser!

823
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:45,998
God dammit,
I blush to think of it!

824
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:49,695
What a fucking dud product!

825
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,169
I haven't kept up
with the times!

826
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:58,643
That's the bitter truth.

827
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,651
But I'm going to get
my act together, Kalle.

828
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:08,153
We'll have to find
something else to sell

829
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:13,522
with a few extra zeros on it.

830
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:22,333
If I think of something...

831
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,234
I'll call. Bye, Kalle!

832
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:23,855
Is that Sven?

833
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,813
Is that you, Sven?

834
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,518
Why are you following me, Sven?

835
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,953
Why are you tormenting me?

836
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:53,761
I can't make it up to you.

837
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,125
How could I do that?

838
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,364
You have no relatives.

839
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:04,563
What can I do?

840
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,740
Sven!

841
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,970
Can we not treat each other
decently?

842
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,809
Forget it all.

843
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,785
The past...
Just look ahead!

844
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:24,615
I'd be really happy
if we could do that, Sven.

845
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,928
You have to see it
from my perspective.

846
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,330
I can't take it any more.

847
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,362
I can't take it any more!

848
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,676
I just can't take it any more!

How much can you ask
of a person?

851
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,717
You do what you can.

852
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:35,455
You struggle...

01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:37,621
...to get a bit of food
on the table.
