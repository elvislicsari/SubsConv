		<h2>SubSynch - About</h2>
		<p>
			Sub Synch is meant to help you synchronize any subtitles that are not correctly mapped to a movie. It has happend a lot to me lately to find subtitles that are not correctly synchronized to a movie i wanted to watch. So the solution is pretty simple: instead of looking for a subtitle that will actually be synchronized with the movie, wasting time finding it, getting frustrated if you don't find it like i do now and then, download the first subtitle you come across and just synchronize it to the correct framerate. From my point of view, Sub Synch is pretty straightforward to use, but if you have any problems or you don't understand how to use it, you can use the short informations provided on the synchronize page (see the info button) or you can read the faq page.

		</p>
		<h2>SubSynch - Functionality</h2>
		<p>
			Sub Synch is designed to synchronize the subtitle in 3 framerates: 23.976, 25.000 and 29.97. Also, you can change the type of subtitle into SubRip (.srt file) and MultiDVD (.sub) files. If you want us to expand the tool, to be capable to synchronize subtitles into more framerates, or to be able to handle more subtitles type, please leave us a feedback on Facebook or Twitter.
			Beside the synchronization functionality, using a little help from Google Translator (actually a whole lot of help ;)) you can translate the subtitle in any language you might need.
		</p>
		<h2>SubSynch - Future</h2>
		<p>
			We haven't planned anything important for the future of Sub Synch but we are waiting for your feedback and requests to see if Sub Synch is being helpful to someone, or it needs some more functionality added.
			Also, if you encounter any errors or you have a subtitle that the Sub Synch tool hasn't been able to help you with, please let us know.
			<br />
			We would like to thank the amazing <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google AppEngine</a> platform and <a href="http://spyrestudios.com/">Spyrestudios</a> from whom we stole a little bit from the design ideas.
